# Fish
Using a dataset of various fish species, we aim to predict the weight of the fish based on certain characteristics such as vertical length, diagonal length, cross length, height, and width. We'll employ the Linear Regression method to determine the relationship between these characteristics and the fish's weight.

Species: The species name of the fish
Weight: The weight of the fish in grams
Length1: Vertical length in centimeters
Length2: Diagonal length in centimeters
Length3: Cross length in centimeters
Height: Height in centimeters
Width: Diagonal width in centimeters
