# Fish
Using a dataset of various fish species, we aim to predict the weight of the Bream species fish based on certain characteristics such as vertical length, diagonal length, cross length, height, and width. We'll employ the Linear Regression method to determine the relationship between these characteristics and the fish's weight.

Species: The species name of the fish

Weight: The weight of the fish in grams

Length1: Vertical length in centimeters

Length2: Diagonal length in centimeters

Length3: Cross length in centimeters

Height: Height in centimeters

Width: Diagonal width in centimeters
